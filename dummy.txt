Domain0 in Xen runs all the device drivers for the host machine hardware
Hardware virtualization extensions do NOT offer binary translation acceleration
TinyOS does NOT support updating part of the code at runtime
Grant regions in Tock OS do NOT store kernel states

Short QnA--
Here is pseudocode of a simple spinlock implementation using test-and-set:
This code achieves mutual exclusion, but what are the two potential problems of this lock implementation?
Answer:
No bounded waiting â†’ starvation
High cache coherence traffic due to frequent test-and-set on the same memory location

Consider a hypothetical hard disk drive with 3000 RPM, 100MB/s of data transfer rate, and 10 ms of seek time. If the file system reads data from the disk in a block size of 2MB per access, the latency is [ ] ms and the throughput is [ ] MB/s.
Latency: 0.04 seconds (or 40 ms)
Throughput: 50 MB/s

Consider a virtualization scenario where the hypervisor and the guest OS use 4-level paging. If nested/extended paging is used, what is the number of memory accesses required to translate a guest virtual address to a host physical address? Also, what is the number for shadow paging?
Nested/Extended Paging: 21 memory accesses
Shadow Paging: 5 memory accesses

Why event-driven systems can be more memory efficient than multi-threaded systems?
Event-driven systems use a single stack for scheduling tasks, as opposed to multi-threaded systems which require a separate stack per thread, thus using more memory.
